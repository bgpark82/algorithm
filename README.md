# Algorithm Repo

This is the algorithm achieve to keep tracking of the coding test journey since 2020. It covers [Kakao coding test](https://programmers.co.kr/learn/challenges), [beakjoon](https://www.acmicpc.net/) and other coding test questions by different categories. If you feel like overwhelmed by just looking at the difficult algorithm problems, It would definitely help for you to review the same question over and over until you can confidently explain someone. I inspired by the power of learning by teaching.

## Java

It hasn't been updated, since I switched from Java to C++ in performance reason. but still enable to access to history of the problems.
